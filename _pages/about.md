I obtained my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics with Highest Honors from the College of Letters and Science and Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society from UC Berkeley 2020 - 2024. 

## Research Interest 

I am a rising probabilist, broadly interested in probability theory, stochastic processes, information theory, and cryptography. My work explores the theoretical foundations of randomness and its applications in diverse fields, including cryptographic analysis and mathematical modeling of biological systems.

I am currently volunteering as a full time research assistant under [Professor Steven Evans](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~evans/) at UC Berkeley. Currently, my work focuses on multi-type birth-death processes and recovering tree structures from the joint distribution of the random length sequence of simple edge-weighted trees.
