I am Fangyuan Lin and I'm a PhD student at Columbia University, Department of Statistics. I'm broadly interested in probability theory, information theory, and statistics.

I have experienced firsthand how transformative even a small act of kindness and guidance can be. The generosity of my friends and professors empowered me to grow—so I’m devoted to paying that support forward.
