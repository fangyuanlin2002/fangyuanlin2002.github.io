* Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I believe in bringing warmth to the world through every endeavorâ€”whether it's through teaching or research. My goal is to make meaningful connections that leave a positive impact.

## Acknowledgments

I am forever grateful to the following people:

- **Professor Steven N. Evans (UC Berkeley)**  
  For your mentorship, encouragement, and unwavering support throughout my academic journey.  
- **Dr. Norman Sheu (UC Berkeley)**  
  For your big-brother guidance, generosity, and all those memorable dinners.  
- **Professor Pascal Vontobel (CUHK)**  
  For your kindness, generosity, and invaluable advice.

  I will always strive to pay forward the kindness you have shown me. May I, in time, repay the grace you have shown me when fortune grants me the means.
