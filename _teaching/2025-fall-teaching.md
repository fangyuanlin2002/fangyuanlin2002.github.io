## Communication
- **CourseWorks (Canvas)**: This is where you can find all the official materials, submissions, and annoucements.
- Please scroll down to see the comments I write about the homework/quiz/project. The comments are based on the frequently asked questions during the office hours and my own insights.

## Ways to Succeed in This Course
- **Keep on track** Consistency brings mastery. Don't skip lectures or homeworks.
- **Come to office hours** ‚Äî They‚Äôre for you, whether you‚Äôre confused or just curious - ask questions early and all questions are welcome. I will do my very best to help.
- **You do not need to be a mathematician to succeed** ‚Äî Don‚Äôt be afraid if the equations look heavy at first. The focus is on understanding ideas, running code, and interpreting results, not on doing pages of proofs. The intuition matters more than the algebraic details.


## Homework 1

### Problem 1:
- The demo the professor presented at the end of the lecture on Sep. 9th is relevant.
- Generative AI is great at producing plotting code. Make sure you really understand what the code is doing, and how the grid approximation reflects Bayesian updating.

### Problem 2:
- Pandas are cute üêº
- Be clear what events we are considering.
- For part a, recall the law of total probability.
- For part b, Bayes' rule is your tool. Observing a twin should strengthen your belief that the species is the one that gives birth to twins with more probabiility, right? :)
- For part c, I would use Bayes' rule.
- For part d, follow the hint. As new observations come in, the previous posterior becomes your current prior. 


## FAQ and Trouble Shooting Bugs {#faq}

### R Session aborted when using R-Studio
It's experimentally shown that if your macOS version is something like is 12.5, you should still download R-Studio using the [macOS 13+ (macOS 13 and higher)] option on the official site.
