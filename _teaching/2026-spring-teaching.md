## LaTeX Lecture Notes

I maintain a set of LaTeX lecture notes for this course, hosted on Overleaf:

**[Lecture Notes](https://www.overleaf.com/8582253538gzzmpybwrgsb#d87e5c)**

These notes are meant to supplement the lectures and Prof. Campbell's notes, and attempt to clarify technical details from my personal perspective. They will be updated throughout the semester. And everyone is welcome to contribute and edit :)
